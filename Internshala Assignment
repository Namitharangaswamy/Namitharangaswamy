Write a test code to check each functions and ensure that your entire code follows
the state transition diagram and manages the traffic lights as expected.

def test_traffic_light_system():
    traffic_system = TrafficLightControlSystem()

    try:
        print("Traffic Light System Simulation Starting...")
        traffic_system.run_traffic_light_system()

    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        print("Simulation stopped by the user.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_traffic_light_system()
